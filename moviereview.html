            Agent Movie: Artists Review
            Akhil underwent a remarkable transformation for the role of Agent. He shed his loverboy image and showed variations in his expressions, dialogue delivery, and mannerisms. To the top of it, he enacted deadly, breathtaking, and risky stunts and action sequences. He also entertained delivering dialogues in a Telangana accent. He did everything that was required of him by the director and tried to carry the film on his shoulders. If he improves to showcase more intensity, he will reach the next level. He looked stylish and cool on the screen.
            
            Mammootty made his presence felt with his sedate performance. Though his screen presence is good, his role did not get much elevation. Dino Maria who played the antagonist role just passed through the motions. His role looked routine. Sakshi Vaidya looked hot and gorgeous on the screen. She got limited scope to showcase her acting talent. Sampath Raj and Varalakshmi Sarathkumar got limited roles. Others like Murali Sharma, Posani Krishna Murali, and Vikramjit played blink-and-miss roles. Urvashi Rautela did a special song and she looked raunchy as usual.
